  <p> Hi my name is Jameela Frances Kidd. I am 15 years old and I am going to be 16 on July 22. I run track and i am in the marching band at Heritage High School. Ive been running track since 8th grade. This is my first time doing anything with computer science and I enjoy it very much. When I leave high school I plan to go to Kennesaw State University. Before I came to Girls Who Code camp I wanted to go to college and major in nursing, but now I want to major in computer science. I've learned so much in this camp and I am excited to learn more.
